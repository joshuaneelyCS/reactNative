<h1>Comparing Speech with Dynamic Time Warping in Python</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project compares the similarity between two audio files using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). The GetScore program takes in two audio files, extracts a numpy array representing the frequencies at a given time, converts them into Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and then performs the DTW algorithm using euclidean distances between each point. This then outputs a distance representing the similarities between them. The lower the number, the more similar they are.
