<h1>Speech Leaderboard App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This app records the audio from the user and then compares it to an audio clip from the movie Shrek. The goal will be for the app to use Dynamic Time Warping to return a score to the user that represents how similarly the user said the phrase from Shrek. This will then be put on a leaderbaord where users compete to see who can say the phrase best.
